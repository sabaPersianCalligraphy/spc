            "Listen to the tan-tan, tan-tan beat, O worshiper of the body."

        It is the closing verse of Ghazal No. 516 from Rumi’s Divan-e Shams, where Rumi contrasts two states of being: the ecstatic wine-drinkers and those attached only to the body.<br>
        The first hemistich has been transformed into a Siyah Mashq calligraphic composition.

        <h4>Explanation of “تَنتَن” (Tan-Tan)</h4>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">
            In classical Persian poetry, poets follow prosodic rules (ʿarūż) to determine the meter and rhythm of their verses.<br>
            One of the traditional methods of scansion involves using the syllables “تَ” (ta) for a short syllable and “تَن” (tan) for a long syllable.<br>
            Here, Rumi deliberately uses “تَنتَن تَنتَن” in the last hemistich of Ghazal No. 516 to mimic the rhythmic structure of the poem itself.
            It symbolically evokes:<br>
            the hidden heartbeat of the verse,<br>
            the pulse of existence,<br>
            and the music of life that only those immersed in the inner experience, the “wine-drinkers”, can truly hear.<br>
            Thus, the phrase “tan-tan, tan-tan” works on two levels:<br>
            Technical: It mirrors the rhythmic scansion pattern used by classical Persian poets.<br>
            Poetic: It conveys the subtle, unspoken beat of life that escapes those focused only on the surface, the “body-worshipers.”<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
        In this verse, Rumi contrasts two states of being: the wine-drinkers and the body-worshipers. The wine-drinkers are those who have tasted a sense of inner freedom and ecstasy; they have moved beyond the narrow confines of the mind and touched a deeper experience of life, where joy flows from within and is not dependent on external factors. In contrast, the body-worshipers remain caught in superficial pleasures, daily routines, and fleeting excitements, unaware of the deeper layers of existence. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
        The phrase “tan-tan tan-tan” symbolizes the hidden rhythm of life, the subtle music that the wine-drinkers feel and dance to with their whole being, while for the body-worshipers it remains just a hollow, meaningless echo. This verse is an invitation to move beyond appearances and listen to the silent music flowing through the depths of being and the fabric of each moment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
        "This Ghazal is composed for sama, dance, and melody. Jalal al-Din Rumi deeply realized that existence cannot be understood or defined; it can only be experienced, and one can only truly dance with existence itself."
