        This line can be read as a report of a shift in gaze: the moment a person slips out of the skin of habit and the world appears not “as it is called” but “as it is.” The “strange feeling” here is not an unpleasant defenselessness; it is a boundless, unmarked expanse, somewhere between the familiar and the unfamiliar, where the weight of the “I” grows light and things take on meaning anew. The “migratory bird” is not merely a bird in the sky; it is a form taken by the seeking heart, gathering the seasons and making the path its home instead of seeking a home, worshipping neither staying nor arriving, but nesting in the middle of the way.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
        In this reading, life is nameless movement itself: an invisible wind that blows over the feathers of attention and shifts the vantage point a little, so that things step out of the margins and silence is heard beneath the noise of everyday affairs. Estrangement is not a sign of being far from one’s homeland; it is a sign of nearing a horizon for which we have no name yet.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
        Thus, <span class="italic">“Life is the strange feeling a migratory bird has”</span> is not an account of sorrow but a description of quiet freedom: the freedom to become lighter, less named, and to see anew, a sustained flight in which wherever it grows lighter and clearer, that is “arrival,” even if one is still in the middle of the way.
