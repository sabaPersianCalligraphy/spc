        <h3>Silent Companions: The Power of Personalized Art</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">A home filled with random objects may reflect the noise of the world, but a home with art reflects the voice of the soul.</p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">Imagine your home filled not just with objects, but with symbols of who you aspire to be. Personalized artwork, especially when rooted in wisdom, language, and beauty, acts as a visual affirmation of your highest self. It reminds you, gently but persistently, of your core values, your inner potential, your dreams, and your spiritual path.</p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">This is where the true magic happens:</p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8 font-semibold">A personalized artwork becomes a silent companion on your journey of growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
        <h3>Home as a Sacred Mirror of the Soul</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">When each piece of art in your home reflects the higher version of you, your space becomes a living altar, a place of not only comfort but transcendence.</p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">In such a home:</p>
        <ul class="pl-6 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-8">
            <li>You are reminded of who you are when the world tries to make you forget.</li>
            <li>
                Your children grow up around symbols of wisdom and beauty, absorbing them in subtle, powerful ways.
            </li>
            <li>Visitors feel something they can‚Äôt explain, but it stays with them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">Home is not just a physical structure, it‚Äôs emotional, energetic, and sacred. A house built with conscious art and soulful values becomes a luminous sanctuary radiating peace and presence. </p>

        <h3>Commissioning Persian Calligraphy: Styles, Pricing & Process</h3>
        
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">If you have a Persian poem or phrase that you would like to bring to life, we can create a custom calligraphy artwork either in your choice of Nasta ølƒ´q or Siyah Mashq (the abstract, expressive form) to add depth and beauty to your artistic collection. To place your order, please follow the structure below. If you are still searching for the perfect verse, one that resonates with your dream, life purpose, or legacy, we invite you to schedule a complimentary consultation session. Together, we‚Äôll explore verses that align with your journey and offer personalized guidance to help you discover the words that are truly yours.</p>
        
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">Our commissioned artworks unite two of the most cherished traditions in Persian art: calligraphy and illumination (Tazhib). Through a deeply collaborative process, SaBa, the calligrapher, and Narvan, the master of illumination, merge their distinct crafts into a single, harmonious masterpiece. SaBa sets the foundation with expressive flowing script, while Narvan enhances the piece with intricate geometric patterns, elegant floral motifs, and finely detailed miniature elements. Together, they transform the written word into a visual composition tailored to reflect your unique taste and vision.</p>

        <h4>Proposal & Quote</h4>
        <p class="text-lg leading-8">
            Every commission is unique. Instead of a fixed price list, each piece is quoted individually after we review your request form and discuss scope, size, materials, passe-partout design, and any illumination or framing. (Materials and presentation options are detailed in the section below.) Please complete the Commission Request Form to begin.</p>
