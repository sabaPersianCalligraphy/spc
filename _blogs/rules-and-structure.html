  <p class="text-lg leading-8">
    Persian calligraphy, particularly the Nastaʿlīq script, which is the focus of this article, has undergone a profound and centuries-long evolution. Generations of devoted artists have dedicated their lives, often spending countless hours honing and perfecting its form. This refinement has not been guided merely by personal taste or individual aesthetic; rather, it is firmly rooted in a foundation of scientific understanding, mathematical precision, and the core visual principles of art. Those who have shaped and elevated this tradition did so with deep mastery and scholarly rigor, advancing it through a delicate balance of discipline, creativity, and cultural reverence.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-8">
    In this section, I will briefly introduce some of the key principles and rules of the Nastaʿlīq script. However, this is only a glimpse into the richness of this noble art. I intend to delve deeper into its many dimensions through an ongoing series of articles to be shared here in the future.

    <h3>Unit of Measurement</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      To measure any phenomenon, the first essential step is to establish a standard unit. In Persian calligraphy, this unit is elegantly defined by the width of the pen’s nib. Traditional reed pens, or qalam (Latin: Calamus), are carved with a flat, angled tip that when dipped in ink and touched to paper creates a linear mark rather than the round dot produced by modern ballpoint pens. This initial stroke, known as the "dot", becomes the foundational unit of measurement in classical scripts like Nastaʿlīq. Depending on the pen’s size, from ultra-fine to broad, the width of this mark sets the scale and proportion for every letter and word. It is a brilliantly functional standard, ensuring that the visual harmony of the script remains intrinsically linked to the tool itself and to the dimensions of the composition.
    </p>

      <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 1: Unit of Measurement in Persian calligraphy</p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      Over the centuries, guided by this standard of measurement, calligraphers have drawn upon experience, knowledge, relentless practice, and a refined understanding of aesthetic principles to develop a rich and precise system for shaping letters, forming words, and composing layouts. This discipline has culminated in a visual language that is coherent, harmonious, and profoundly captivating.

    <h3>Example 1: Examining the Letter “Alef”</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      As shown in the image, the classical length of the letter Alef is traditionally measured as three dots. Deviating significantly from this proportion, whether longer or shorter, can disrupt the letter’s inherent beauty and visual balance. However, in calligraphic compositions, slight variations may occur depending on the surrounding letters and spatial relationships. In these instances, it is the calligrapher’s refined eye and artistic sensitivity that ensure the overall harmony of the piece is preserved.

    <h3>Example 1: Examining the Letter “B”</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      In the Nastaʿlīq script, the letter "B" appears in two classical forms, each governed by distinct stylistic rules. The first is the “five-dot B,” compact and traditionally measured by the span of five dots. The second is the “extended B,” whose length can vary from seven to eleven dots, depending on the requirements of the composition. This variation in proportion and form plays a crucial role in shaping the visual rhythm and harmony of the piece. The selection between the two is determined by the letter’s position within a word and the calligrapher’s aesthetic judgment.

  While the primary aim of this article is not to conduct a comprehensive study of letter height-to-width proportions, I will briefly address this topic using two illustrative examples. I intend to explore this subject more thoroughly in future writings, fully recognizing that its complexity cannot be adequately captured in a single piece or even in several. That said, the accompanying images offer additional examples of letters and words, where their proportions are visually demonstrated using dot-based measurements.

  <div>
    <h3>Proportions Between Length and Width</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      It is important to note that the three dots shown in Example 1 must be proportionate to the thickness of the letter Alef itself. As such, both the <strong>angle</strong> of the pen and the <strong>direction</strong> of its movement are crucial in achieving the correct proportion and harmony in the form.
    </p>
        <div>
      <img loading="lazy" class="w-full md:max-w-3/5 md:mx-auto"src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/aboutPersianCalligraphy/analysis-the-movement-and-angle-persian-calligraphy-01.jpg" alt="Proportions Between Length and Width in Persian calligraphy">
      <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 5: How the initial pen angle on paper affects the thickness of movement.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Initial Pen Angle on Paper</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      One of the most critical elements in shaping letterforms is the angle at which the pen touches the paper at the start of movement. Much like pivotal choices in life, the initial moment of contact determines the direction of the stroke and often foretells its outcome. In that first gesture, one can already feel: was the beginning made correctly? Will it guide the form toward the vision I hold or away from it?
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      This is because the pen’s angle governs the play of thickness and delicacy, laying the groundwork for the visual contrast that defines calligraphy. Achieving the ideal beginning requires mastery of subtle, layered techniques, skills cultivated only through devoted practice. In this process, even the way the pen is held, and the posture of the calligrapher in relation to the paper, become vital. These details shape not only the control of movement but the accurate transfer of energy from hand to ink, from thought to form.
    </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Energy Transmission</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      Energy transmission, at its core, is the passage of passion, love, and enthusiasm or more truthfully, the artist’s very soul flowing through pen and ink onto the surface of the paper. This phenomenon is not just a technical occurrence, but a deeply profound and thought-provoking element of the creative process. For this flow of energy to be meaningful, it must grow and evolve in harmony with the artist’s mastery of technique, principles, and form. Along this journey, reflection on anthropology and self-knowledge becomes essential, serving as a pillar for the cultivation of authentic expression because ultimately one must ask: Who is the one that sets this pen in motion? And what inner truth guides its path?
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Direction of Movement</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      Once a proper beginning is made, the essential question emerges: In which direction will the pen move? What path will it trace? Like the unfolding journey of life, this movement demands constant awareness moment by moment. To be fully present in the act of writing is to sense and shape every subtle shift, every curve, every pause. It is in this attentive motion that creativity reveals its true essence, presence becoming form, awareness becoming art.
    </p>
          <div>
        <img loading="lazy"  class="w-full md:max-w-4/5 md:mx-auto"src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/aboutPersianCalligraphy/analysis-the-movement-and-measurement-persian-calligraphy-02.jpg" alt="Direction of Movement in Persian calligraphy">
        <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 7: Direction of Movement</p>
      </div>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      As the pen moves, it shapes both black and white spaces, composing subtle rhythms. With each shift in angle, it creates contrasts of thickness and delicacy. From this motion, a harmony of proportion is born, emerging from a fusion of skill, intuition, and the calligrapher’s moment-to-moment presence.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h3>Proportions in Movements</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      Principles such as the golden ratio and classical geometric structures serve as powerful tools for revealing the intricate proportions within letters, words, and calligraphic compositions. Structurally, this is among the most demanding and sophisticated aspects of calligraphy where technical precision meets artistic intuition. Mastering these proportions requires not only years of devoted practice, but also a refined aesthetic sensibility and an intuitive grasp of the visual harmony between each element of a word.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      In the example shown in the image, the letter “Sīn” is connected to “Te” to form a unified composition, which has been analyzed using the proportions of the golden rectangle to achieve visual harmony and balance.

    <h3>Types of Rhythms in Movements</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      Rhythm in visual art extends beyond dimensions such as length, width, and depth, it emerges through angles, repetition, and the careful balance of black and white space. As illustrated in the image, these rhythmic patterns operate on multiple levels: from the curves of a single letter to the structure of entire words, and ultimately across the full composition. This precise interplay of visual rhythms creates a cohesive and dynamic harmony, an essential hallmark of a truly compelling work of art.

  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h3>End of the Line, Beginning of Vision</h3>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
      The art of calligraphy is more than the pursuit of beautiful writing, it is a journey inward.<br>
      A journey where proportions, angles, rhythms, and rules serve not as ends, but as vessels to express something far more essential: the awakened soul of the artist. Every dot, every stroke of the pen becomes an echo of perception, intuition, and presence, each line drawn in full awareness of the moment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-8">
     While mastering technique and visual principles is vital, it is the human presence behind the line, the one who dares to ask, “Who am I, and why do I write?” that breathes life into form. Perhaps it is in asking that question that the first living line is born, one that does not merely please the eye, but stirs the spirit.

      In this sacred process, the calligraphic work becomes a silent, eloquent teacher, one that guides more than it shows, reveals more than it tells. It teaches not only balance, rhythm, and harmony, but also the unseen essence we call beauty.
