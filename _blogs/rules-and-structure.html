  <p class="text-lg">
    The art of calligraphy, particularly Nastaʿlīq script, which is the focus of this article,has undergone a long process of evolution over the centuries. Countless artists have dedicated years and countless hours of their lives to refining and elevating this script. This process has not merely been driven by personal taste or individual aesthetics; rather, it is grounded in a solid foundation of scientific principles, mathematical rules, and the visual fundamentals of art. Those who have contributed to the formation and growth of this art have possessed deep mastery of these principles and have strived with scholarly precision to advance it.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg">
    In this section, I will briefly touch upon some of the principles and rules of the Nastaʿlīq script. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that I hope to introduce and explore more dimensions of this noble art in the future through a series of continuous articles on this very page.

    <h3>Unit of Measurement</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      To measure any phenomenon, the first step is to define a unit of measurement. In calligraphy, the width of the pen’s nib during writing is chosen as the standard unit. Since a reed pen (qalam) is carved in such a way that its tip has a flat edge, its first contact with the paper, after being dipped in ink, produces a linear mark, rather than a round dot like that of a typical ballpoint pen. This width, which varies depending on the type of pen from very fine to large sizes, forms the fundamental basis for determining the size and proportion of letters and words in Nastaʿlīq script. It is a clever choice that ensures proportionality remains aligned with both the tool and the scale of the work.
    </p>

      <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 1: Unit of Measurement in Persian calligraphy</p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Based on this measurement standard, calligraphers over the centuries, drawing on experience, knowledge, continuous practice, and a deep understanding of aesthetic principles, have developed a rich set of precise rules for writing letters, forming words, and composing layouts. These rules have ultimately led to the creation of a coherent, harmonious, and visually captivating structure.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h3>Example 1: Examining the Letter “Alef”</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      As shown in the image, the classical length of the letter Alef is considered to be three dots (Picture 2- N.1). If this length is noticeably more or less, it detracts from the beauty and balance of the letter (Picture 2: See Numbers 2 and 3). However, in calligraphic compositions, depending on the proximity to other letters and words, this length may slightly vary. In such cases, it is the calligrapher’s keen eye and aesthetic sensitivity that play a crucial role in maintaining the overall harmony.
    </p>

    </div>

  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h3>Example 1: Examining the Letter “B”</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      In Nastaʿlīq script, this letter is written in two classical styles, each with its own specific writing rules. The first form is the around “five-dot B” (Picture 3). The second is the “extended B” (Picture 4), whose length, depending on the needs of the composition, is considered to range between 7 to 11 dots. The difference in size and writing style between these two forms has a significant impact on the visual balance and rhythm of the composition. The choice between them depends on the letter’s position within the word and the calligrapher’s artistic judgment.

  <p class="text-lg">
  Since the aim of this article is not solely to examine the proportions of letter height and width, I will limit the discussion to these two examples. I hope to explore this aspect in greater detail in future writings, though I am fully aware that such a topic cannot be thoroughly covered in just one or even several standalone articles. Nevertheless, in the accompanying images, additional examples of letters and words are provided, with their proportions visually demonstrated through dot-based measurements.

    <h3>Proportions Between Length and Width</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      It is important to note that the three dots mentioned in Example 1 must be proportionate to the thickness of the letter Alef itself. Therefore, the <strong>angle</strong> of the pen and the <strong>direction</strong> of its movement play a key role in correctly forming this proportion.
    </p>
        <div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Initial Pen Angle on Paper</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      One of the key factors in the formation of letterforms is the angle at which the pen is placed at the start of movement. The very beginning of each stroke, like many decisions in life, plays a decisive role and can determine both the direction of the movement and the final outcome. At that moment, one can already sense: was the beginning made correctly? Will it lead to the form I envision, or not? This is because the angle directly affects the variations in thickness and delicacy of the letters, and forms the foundation of many of the visual contrasts in calligraphy. Achieving the ideal beginning is the result of mastering many subtle techniques, something attainable only through extensive practice. In this process, the correct way of <strong>holding the pen</strong> and the <strong>positioning of the calligrapher’s body in relation to the paper</strong> are essential details that directly influence movement control and the precise <strong>transfer of energy </strong>to the pen’s tip.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Energy Transmission</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Energy transmission is, in essence, the transfer of passion, enthusiasm, love, or more precisely, the artist’s soul, through the pen and ink onto the surface of the paper. This phenomenon is a profound and thought-provoking aspect of the artistic creation process. The flow of energy must evolve and flourish alongside the learning of techniques, rules, and principles of any art form. Along this path, reflection on anthropology and self-knowledge is also considered a fundamental pillar in the cultivation of authentic art, because, ultimately, the question arises: Who is it that sets this pen in motion? And what is their purpose in doing so?
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Direction of Movement</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      After a proper beginning, the essential question is: in which direction will the pen move? What is its path? Just like the course of life, this movement requires constant awareness at every moment. Full presence in the act of writing means perceiving and controlling every shift in direction, every curve, and every pause. One could say that it is this very presence in motion that fully manifests the meaning and essence of creativity.
    </p>
          <div>
        <img loading="lazy"  class="w-full max-w-4/5 mx-auto"src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/aboutPersianCalligraphy/analysis-the-movement-and-measurement-persian-calligraphy-02.jpg" alt="Direction of Movement in Persian calligraphy">
        <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 7: Direction of Movement</p>
      </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      As it moves, the pen creates both black and white spaces, generates various rhythms, and, through shifts in its angle, produces contrasts of thickness and thinness. Within this movement, delicate proportions between lines emerge, born from a fusion of skill, intuition, and the calligrapher’s moment-to-moment awareness.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h3>Proportions in Movements</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Concepts such as the golden ratio and classical geometric structures offer valuable tools for explaining and better understanding the proportions within letters, words, and calligraphic compositions. Structurally, this is considered one of the most complex and challenging aspects of the art of calligraphy. Achieving such proportions not only requires years of dedicated practice, but also demands a profound sense of aesthetics and an intuitive understanding of the visual relationships between the elements of a word.

    <h3>Types of Rhythms in Movements</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Rhythm plays a role not only in dimensions (length, width, and thickness), but also in angles, repetition, and in the creation of black and white space. As shown in the image, these rhythms are present on multiple levels, from the formation of a single letter to the structure of a word, and ultimately throughout the entire composition. The precise interplay of these rhythms leads to the creation of a cohesive and dynamic harmony, which is one of the defining features of a true work of art.

    <h3>End of the Line, Beginning of Vision</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
      The art of calligraphy goes beyond beautiful writing, it's a journey inward. A journey in which proportions, angles, rhythms, and rules are merely tools to express something deeper: the conscious soul of the artist. Every dot and every stroke of the pen echoes perception, intuition, and a profound presence in the moment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Although learning technical principles and visual rules is essential for shaping this art, what truly brings the line to life is the human presence behind it—the person who asks: “Who am I? And why do I write?” <br>
      And perhaps that very question is the beginning of writing a line that is not only beautiful, but alive.
    </p>
      <div>
        <img loading="lazy"  class="w-full max-w-120 mx-auto"src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/sillWet/thumbnail/stilWet-D-01.jpg" alt="A Nastaʿlīq-based abstract composition by SaBa">

      </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      In this process, the calligraphic work itself becomes a silent yet eloquent teacher, guiding the artist, teaching subtleties, proportions, rhythms, harmonies, and that which can only be called: beauty.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h4>This writing is the beginning of a path that will continue.</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">
      In future writings, these topics will be explored in greater depth, with more examples and attention to other dimensions of this art, because calligraphy is an endless world that offers a fresh vision each time we return to it.
