        By most accounts, the earliest examples of Nastaʿlīq appeared in western Iran in the early part of the second half of the eighth Islamic century (c. 1350–1374 CE), contemporaneous with the rise of Mīr ʿAlī Tabrīzī (1378–1446 CE). Although forms very close to Nastaʿlīq can be seen in some manuscripts and documents prior to Mīr ʿAlī’s time, it was he who presented it as an independent script, gave it a distinct identity, and established defined rules for it. It is said that by combining Naskh and Taʿlīq, Mīr ʿAlī created a captivating script first called “Naskh-Taʿlīq” and later “Nastaʿlīq”, the very script in which a large portion of Persian texts is written today.

      <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
        Arthur Upham Pope (1881–1969), the renowned historian and Iranologist of Iranian art, held that Naskh is a complete and balanced script and Taʿlīq is forceful and authoritative; from the fusion of these two, Nastaʿlīq emerged, a caressing, elegant, calm, and gentle script that offers an exalted image of Iranian refinement and worldliness.

      <h3 class="md:clear-left">Jaʿfar Tabrizi (d. 1480/1481 CE)</h3>
      <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
        Jaʿfar Tabrizi (d. 1480/1481 CE) was one of the master Iranian calligraphers of the 15th century, also known by the honorific “Bāysonqorī.” He was the greatest Nastaʿlīq scribe of his time. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
        Among his renowned works is the Bāysonqorī Shāhnāmeh, completed in 1430 CE. The Baysonghori Shāhnāmeh (15th century CE), which is housed in the Library of the Golestan Palace Museum. The present copy of the Baysonghori Shāhnāmeh was donated to the Golestan Palace Museum Library by Amir Nezam Garusi, and it has been preserved there for over 110 years.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
       Another work by Mirzā Jaʿfar Tabrizi is a precious muraqqaʿ (album) in the Library of the University of Tübingen, Germany, which contains outstanding examples of Thuluth, Rayḥān, Naskh, Riqāʿ, Tawqīʿ, and Nastaʿlīq scripts. Mirzā Jaʿfar strove greatly to popularize Nastaʿlīq and, in a short time, made it accepted by both elites and the public. He learned this script directly from his teacher, Mir ʿAbdullāh—the son of Mir ʿAlī Tabrīzī—and is said to have surpassed even the founder of Nastaʿlīq, Mir ʿAlī, in it.

      <h3 class="md:clear-left">Sultan ‛Ali Mashhadi (1435–1520 CE)</h3>
      <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
        Sultan-ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Mashhadī, known as Sultan-ʿAlī Mashhadī and honorifically titled Sulṭān al-Khattātīn and Niẓām al-Dīn Sulṭānī (1435–1520 CE), was an Iranian calligrapher and one of the most renowned Nastaʿlīq scribes of 15th–16th-century Iran.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
        His most important work is a versified treatise in the masnavī form on the rules of calligraphy, later titled Ṣirāṭ al-Suṭūr (“Path of the Lines”); Mīr ʿAlī Haravī called it Ṣirāṭ al-Khaṭṭ. However, Sultan-ʿAlī himself did not give it any title.
