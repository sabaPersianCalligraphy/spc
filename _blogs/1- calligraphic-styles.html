        <h3>The Kufic script</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
        It can be said that this script emerged around fifteen centuries ago. Kufic script is primarily composed of straight, angular lines, with very little curvature or roundness. Most styles of this script feature long, continuous vertical and horizontal strokes.

            Throughout history, more than thirty different styles of Kufic script have developed, many of which are named after the places where they were commonly used.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Despite having been created centuries ago, Kufic script continues to inspire artists and captivate modern audiences. With its geometric structure and abstract qualities, it plays a prominent role in various fields of contemporary art, including graphic design, tilework, and conceptual art.

       <h3>The Six Scripts</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
            In the early 4th century AH (around 922 CE), Ibn Muqla Bayzawi of Shiraz developed a set of scripts known as the Six Scripts. In fact, these scripts were selected by him from among various existing styles, and he introduced innovations in their proportions and formal aesthetics. These scripts, also referred to as the Principle Scripts, are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul class="pl-6 list-decimal list-outside md:col-span-5">
            <li class="font-semibold">Muḥaqqaq</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Rayḥān</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Thuluth</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Naskh</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Riqāʿ</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Tawqīʿ</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg">
            What distinguishes these scripts from one another is the variation in the form of letters and words, as well as the ratio between straight and curved movements in their structure.

            <img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/aboutPersianCalligraphy/calligraphic-styles/Muhaqqaq_script.gif" alt="muhaqqaq-scrip-persian-calligraphy">

        </div>

        <h3 class="clear-left">1. Muḥaqqaq Script</h3>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left py-4">
            The Muḥaqqaq script, often referred to by calligraphers as the “father of all scripts,” is considered the closest in style to simple Kufic. Its letterforms are upright, uniform, and bold, marked by a stately appearance and strong visual balance. Each letter maintains a distinct, well-defined structure, making it easily distinguishable from others.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            Muḥaqqaq is known for its grandeur and elegance, featuring consistent spacing and clean, uncluttered forms. It is defined by a curvature-to-straightness ratio of approximately 1.5 to 4 (measured in units of pen width), which enhances its majestic and composed visual character.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left py-4">
            The script reached its peak of use and artistic development during the Mamluk period (1250–1516 CE), when it was employed extensively in manuscripts and architectural inscriptions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            The name <em>Muḥaqqaq</em> itself means “perfect” or “clear,” and was originally used to describe any masterfully executed, refined work of calligraphy, embodying precision, clarity, and formal excellence.
        </p>

        <h3 class="clear-left">2. Rayḥān Script</h3>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left pt-4">
            The Rayḥān script emerged about a century after the development of Muḥaqqaq and closely resembles it, to the extent that it was often referred to as the “slender Muḥaqqaq.” Rayḥān, or "fine Muḥaqqaq," is a style of Arabic calligraphy derived from the Muḥaqqaq script. It retains all the structural features of Muḥaqqaq but is more delicate and compact in form. Because of its elegance and graceful proportions, it has been likened to flowers, leaves, and basil, hence the name Rayḥān (meaning "basil").
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left py-4">
            This script was developed for easier and more fluid writing, with the intent of applying the Muḥaqqaq style to more concise and practical uses. Rayḥān is an elongated and orderly script that was especially used in Qur’anic manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            The script is attributed to Ibn al-Bawwāb, who is credited with its creation.

            <h3>3. Thuluth Script</h3>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Thuluth script, with its dignified and upright structure, has been primarily used for book decoration and architectural inscriptions. Its gradual development as an ornamental script was shaped by renowned masters such as Ibn Muqla, Ibn al-Bawwāb, and Yāqūt al-Mustaʿṣamī. Ibn al-Bawwāb is especially credited with introducing elegance and refinement into Thuluth.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                In Iran, Thuluth has been widely employed for writing the titles of Qur’anic surahs, book covers, chapter headings, and especially in architectural inscriptions and tilework, where it remains popular to this day. It is characterized by elongated vertical alifs and relatively shallow, open circular forms.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                In Thuluth, words may appear separated or intricately interwoven and stacked, which can at times reduce legibility. Compared to Muḥaqqaq, Thuluth contains more curved elements and smaller letter proportions. While its letterforms are still bold, they are more compact. Loops and knots may appear open or, in some cases, tightly closed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                A striking rhythm is produced through the repetition of tall vertical strokes, evoking a sense of grandeur and power. The ends of letters often extend into fine, tapering strokes called tashmīrāt, which may appear in flowing forms or as complex arcs and sunken circles.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                The curvature-to-straightness ratio in Thuluth is approximately 2:1. The pen’s cutting angle used to create tashmīrāt is typically highly inclined (known as qaṭṭ muḥarraf), often between 35° and 45°, though some scholars have classified it as moderately slanted, between 15° and 25°.
