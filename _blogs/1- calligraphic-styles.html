        <h3>The Kufic script</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
            The Kufic script is believed to have emerged around fifteen centuries ago. Characterized by its straight, angular lines and minimal curvature, it conveys a sense of structure and solidity. Most variations of Kufic feature long, continuous vertical and horizontal strokes, giving the script its distinctive geometric harmony.

    <!-- The Six Scripts -->
    <article class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
       <h3>The Six Scripts</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
            In the early 4th century AH (circa 922 CE), Ibn Muqla Bayzawi of Shiraz refined and developed a group of calligraphic styles that became known as the Six Scripts. Rather than creating them entirely from scratch, he carefully selected these scripts from among various existing styles, standardizing their proportions and elevating their formal aesthetics. These styles, later referred to as the Principle Scripts, are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul class="pl-6 list-decimal list-outside md:col-span-5">
            <li class="font-semibold">Muḥaqqaq</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Rayḥān</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Thuluth</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Naskh</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Riqāʿ</li>
            <li class="font-semibold">Tawqīʿ</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg">
            These scripts are distinguished by their variations in letter and word forms, as well as by the ratio between straight lines and curved strokes in their structure.
        </p>
    </article>

    <!-- Muḥaqqaq Script -->
    <article>
        <div class="hidden float-right w-full my-4 md:block md:w-2/5 md:ml-6">
            <img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/aboutPersianCalligraphy/calligraphic-styles/Muhaqqaq_script.gif" alt="muhaqqaq-scrip-persian-calligraphy">
            <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 6: Muhaqqaq Script</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="clear-left">1. Muḥaqqaq Script</h3>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            The Muḥaqqaq script, revered by calligraphers as the “father of all scripts,” is considered the closest in style to simple Kufic. Its letterforms are upright, uniform, and bold, marked by a stately appearance and strong visual balance. Each letter maintains a distinct, well-defined structure, making it easily distinguishable from others.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            Muḥaqqaq is known for its grandeur and elegance, featuring consistent spacing and clean, uncluttered forms. It is defined by a curvature-to-straightness ratio of approximately 1.5 to 4 (measured in units of pen width), which enhances its majestic and composed visual character.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            The script reached its peak of use and artistic development during the Mamluk period (1250–1516 CE), when it was employed extensively in manuscripts and architectural inscriptions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            The name <em>Muḥaqqaq</em> itself means “perfect” or “clear,” and was originally used to describe any masterfully executed, refined work of calligraphy, embodying precision, clarity, and formal excellence.
        </p>

        <div class="hidden float-right w-full my-4 md:block md:w-2/5 md:ml-6">
            <img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/artworks_img_public_bucket/saba-persian-calligraphy/aboutPersianCalligraphy/calligraphic-styles/Rayhani.jpg" alt="rayhān-scrip-persian-calligraphy">
            <p class="text-xs font-thin text-center">Picture 7: Rayhān Script</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="clear-left">2. Rayḥān Script</h3>
        <p class="pt-4 text-lg clear-left">
            The Rayḥān script emerged about a century after the development of Muḥaqqaq and closely resembles it, to the extent that it was often referred to as the “slender Muḥaqqaq.” Rayḥān, or "fine Muḥaqqaq," is a style of Arabic calligraphy derived from the Muḥaqqaq script. It retains all the structural features of Muḥaqqaq but is more delicate and compact in form. Because of its elegance and graceful proportions, it has been likened to flowers, leaves, and basil, hence the name Rayḥān (meaning "basil").
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            This script was developed for easier and more fluid writing, with the intent of applying the Muḥaqqaq style to more concise and practical uses. Rayḥān is an elongated and orderly script that was especially used in Qur’anic manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            The script is attributed to Ibn al-Bawwāb, who is credited with its creation.

    <!-- Thuluth Script -->
    <article>
        <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
            <h3>3. Thuluth Script</h3>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Thuluth script, with its dignified and upright structure, has been primarily used for book decoration and architectural inscriptions. Its gradual development as an ornamental script was shaped by renowned masters such as Ibn Muqla, Ibn al-Bawwāb, and Yāqūt al-Mustaʿṣamī. Ibn al-Bawwāb is especially credited with introducing elegance and refinement into Thuluth.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                In Iran, Thuluth has been widely employed for writing the titles of Qur’anic surahs, book covers, chapter headings, and especially in architectural inscriptions and tilework, where it remains popular to this day. It is characterized by elongated vertical alifs and relatively shallow, open circular forms.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                In Thuluth, words may appear separated or intricately interwoven and stacked, which can at times reduce legibility. Compared to Muḥaqqaq, Thuluth contains more curved elements and smaller letter proportions. While its letterforms are still bold, they are more compact. Loops and knots may appear open or, in some cases, tightly closed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                A striking rhythm is produced through the repetition of tall vertical strokes, evoking a sense of grandeur and power. The ends of letters often extend into fine, tapering strokes called tashmīrāt, which may appear in flowing forms or as complex arcs and sunken circles.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                The curvature-to-straightness ratio in Thuluth is approximately 2:1. The pen’s cutting angle used to create tashmīrāt is typically highly inclined (known as qaṭṭ muḥarraf), often between 35° and 45°, though some scholars have classified it as moderately slanted, between 15° and 25°.

        <h3 class="clear-left">4. Naskh Script</h3>
        <p class="pt-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Naskh Script is a calligraphic style that emerged in the 7th century CE. and became more widely recognized by the late 8th century CE. However, it was not commonly used until the end of the 9th century CE. In general, Naskh is a complete, balanced, orderly, clear, and legible script. In terms of letterforms, it bears similarities to Thuluth and Muḥaqqaq-Riḥān scripts. The shapes of the letters are typically semi-flat and semi-rounded, offering high readability.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            In the early days of Islam, the Arabs greatly valued Kufic calligraphy, as it was considered a divine script. However, many regions struggled with reading and writing in the angular Kufic style. As a result, non-Arab regions developed alternative Arabic scripts that were easier to read and write.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            Discoveries from Jabal Sela near Medina indicate that the Naskh style existed at the beginning of Islam and, in fact, it was the primary script, not a branch derived from Kufic.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Naskh script, with its simple, uniform, and highly legible form, is primarily used for writing religious, scholarly, and printed texts. Its structure is balanced, orderly, and free of excessive ornamentation. For this reason, most modern digital Arabic fonts are inspired by this style.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            <strong>Ahmad Nayrizi </strong>(1676–1742 CE.) was one of the greatest Naskh calligraphers of the 12th century AH (late Safavid period), born in the city of Neyriz.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            He founded a distinctive style of Naskh script that was well received by later calligraphers and became known as the Persian Naskh. As he transcribed manuscripts for Shah Sultan Husayn Safavi, he sometimes signed his works with the term "Solṭāni" (Royal).

        </div>

        <h3 class="clear-left">5. Riqāʿ Script</h3>
        <p class="pt-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Riqāʿ script, derived from the word ruqʿah (letter or short note), was developed out of the need for speed and brevity in writing, particularly in correspondence. This script is entirely rounded and occupies less than one-sixth of the writing surface. Its letters are small, short, yet dense and bold.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            A distinctive feature of Riqāʿ is the filled centers of its looped letters, unlike Naskh and Thuluth, where the centers of letters such as fāʾ (ف), or mīm (م) are left open. Horizontal strokes are very short, and the connections between letters are so compact that the ending letters of one word often connect to the initial letters of the next.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            Historically, Riqāʿ was commonly used for private correspondence on small sheets of paper, as well as for writing secular books, pamphlets, stories, and tales. Today, it is no longer used for everyday writing and is primarily valued for its artistic appeal. In modern times, it is employed in the creation of graphic artworks.

        <p class="pt-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Tawqīʿ script is a style of Islamic calligraphy that was developed during the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun and reached its full form in the 5th century AH (11th century CE). The name Tawqīʿ, meaning "signature," reflects its primary use in signing official documents and religious texts.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Visually, it shares similarities with Thuluth and Riqāʿ scripts. However, its letters are generally larger, thicker, and characterized by shallower curves compared to Riqāʿ.

        <h3 class="clear-left">6. Tawqīʿ Script</h3>
        <p class="pt-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Taʿlīq script is the first distinctive style of Persian calligraphy developed specifically by Iranians. It is believed to have emerged in the mid-13th century CE, evolving from a combination and refinement of the Tawqīʿ and Riqāʿ scripts, while also drawing influence from pre-Islamic Iranian scripts and reflecting the unique aesthetic sensibility of Iranian culture. Taʿlīq is considered the first truly Iranian script in the history of Islamic calligraphy.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            This script is characterized by its interwoven and highly connected letterforms, with words and letters written in varying sizes, sometimes large, sometimes small, rather than uniform proportions. It features numerous curves and circular shapes, offering rich potential for creating intricate and expressive compositions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            Due to its complexity, Taʿlīq was mainly practiced by individuals with a high level of literacy and familiarity with calligraphy. It became the preferred script of royal scribes and administrative courts. However, over time, its use declined. Taʿlīq enjoyed full prominence for about a century before being gradually replaced by the Nastaʿlīq script, and later by Shikasteh-Nastaʿlīq, which became more popular.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg clear-left">
            Some scholars believe that the Iranian style of Naskh (used as a cursive script), influenced by ancient Iranian scripts such as Pahlavi and Avestan, also contributed to the development of Taʿlīq.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg clear-left">
            Today, Taʿlīq script has been officially registered as an element of intangible cultural heritage for all Iranians by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts, and Tourism of Iran.

    <!-- Nastaʿlīq Script -->

        <h3>Nastaʿlīq Script</h3>
        <p class="pt-4 text-lg">
            Nastaʿlīq is one of the principal styles of Persian calligraphy, formed from the fusion of the Naskh and Taʿlīq scripts. It is considered the second script uniquely developed by Iranians. The emergence of Nastaʿlīq occurred during the Ilkhanid period (13th–14th centuries CE), alongside major transformations in Persian miniature painting. These two artistic developments took place simultaneously during the golden age of Iranian art.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">
            It is widely believed that the earliest examples of Nastaʿlīq appeared around the late life of Aḥmad Mūsā and the rise of Mīr ʿAlī Tabrīzī in the early second half of the 14th century CE, particularly in western regions of Iran.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            According to old treatises on calligraphy, a famous story tells how Mīr ʿAlī Tabrīzī once dreamed of wild geese flying. The fluid movements of Nastaʿlīq were said to have been inspired by the soft, graceful motions of these birds in flight.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">
            There is a general belief that the forms of Nastaʿlīq letters are derived from nature or music:
        </p>
        <ul class="px-5 space-y-2 text-lg list-disc list-inside">
            <li>vertical strokes resemble trees and flowers,</li>
            <li>curves mirror the rise and fall of meadows, springs, or melodic tones,</li>
            <li>elongated lines reflect green plains and the stretching of sounds,</li>
            <li>the rolling motion of letters and words evokes the bodies of animals, birds, and especially humans.</li>
            <li>the arrangement of sentences has even been compared to the flight of birds or bouquets of flowers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pt-4 text-lg">
            Among these, human forms and expressions seem to have been the most inspiring source, as in Persian poetry the beloved’s beauty is often likened to letters of the alphabet.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">
            The beauty and power of Nastaʿlīq lie in its harmonious distribution of thick and thin strokes, openness and tightness, and short and long gestures, in the elegant structure of letters and compositions, and in the balance and solidity of words and forms. Letters and words can even appear to be dancing, holding hands, or embracing one another.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            A unified piece of beautiful calligraphy, such as a familiar verse or proverb written in Nastaʿlīq, accompanied by illumination (tazhib), painting, or a bright background, can result in a striking work of art.

    <article>

        <h3>Shekasteh-Nastaʿlīq Script</h3>
        <p class="pt-4 text-lg">
            Shekasteh-Nastaʿlīq is the third major style of Persian calligraphy, following Taʿlīq and Nastaʿlīq. The term "shekasteh" means "broken," referring to the way this script was formed by breaking, simplifying, and accelerating the shapes of Nastaʿlīq letters to allow for faster writing.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">
            It originated in early 17th century CE (early 11th century AH), during a period when Persian calligraphy was reaching artistic maturity. Shekasteh developed further and was systematized in the late 18th century CE by Darvīsh ʿAbd al-Majīd Ṭālaqānī, who is credited with perfecting and formalizing its rules.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">
            This style is characterized by:
        </p>
        <ul class="px-5 space-y-2 text-lg list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Highly cursive, flowing forms</li>
            <li>Frequent ligatures and letter connections</li>
            <li>Compressed and slanted shapes</li>
            <li>Reduced use of diacritics</li>
            <li>Dynamic rhythm and visual movement</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pt-4 text-lg">
            Because of its complexity and density, Shekasteh-Nastaʿlīq is more difficult to read than other Persian scripts and is often reserved for artistic compositions rather than everyday writing. Despite that, it remains one of the most expressive and emotionally charged calligraphic styles in the Persian tradition.
