    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Handmade papers, traditionally crafted from plant fibers, have long served as the primary medium for calligraphy and illumination. In preparation and refinement, starch has played an essential role for centuries, valued for its adhesive qualities, softness, and accessibility. Starch is applied at different stages of production: during papermaking itself, in the polishing process (āhār-mohre in Persian), and in the final treatment known as starch pressing. It has been indispensable in giving these papers their strength, sheen, and enduring beauty.

        <h4>What Is Starch Pressing?</h4>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Starch pressing is a traditional finishing technique applied once an artwork has been completed on handmade paper. It is especially valued in the mounting, bordering, and matting of calligraphy and illumination.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            I use starch pressing for all of my artworks.  This method allows each piece to be affixed to its mat with delicacy and precision, achieving a seamless bond that no industrial adhesive can replicate.  The result is both aesthetic and invisible as well as durable,the artwork remains secure after decades without compromising its integrity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            One of the greatest advantages of starch is its purity. Being natural and acid-free, it preserves the artwork without causing discoloration, brittleness, or harm. In contrast, industrial glues often yellow, crack, or leave permanent stains over time, resulting in irreversible damage. Starch pressing not only ensures stability but also safeguards the beauty and authenticity of the artwork for generations to come.

        <h4>Workshop: Learning Starch Pressing</h4>
        <p class="text-lg">
            In this workshop, the entire starch pressing process will be demonstrated step by step in detail. The session begins with a live demonstration of each stage: preparing the starch, setting up the mat, and positioning the artwork. Then, in small groups of 2–4, participants will practice the method by applying starch pressing to their own artworks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            This hands-on practice not only strengthens technical skills but also provides participants with the satisfaction of immediate, visible results, deepening their appreciation for starch pressing as both a method of preservation and a means of enhancing the beauty of artistic works.

        <h4>Materials Needed for Starch Pressing</h4>
        <ul class="ml-6 space-y-2 text-lg list-decimal list-inside md:col-span-4">
            <li>Starch powder</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>A heating tool to gently cook the mixture</li>
            <li>Artwork on Handmade Paper. ( A2/A3 preferred ).</li>
            <li>Acid-free Fabriano cardstock, 200gsm</li>
            <li>Flat Wooden Board</li>
            <ul class="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside md:col-span-4">
                <li>Must be firm and perfectly smooth.</li>
                <li>For an A3 artwork, use at least an A2 board.</li>
                <li>For A4 or smaller, an A3 board is sufficient.</li>
                <li>Best made from solid natural wood (not MDF or veneer), with a flat, smooth surface.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Roller</li>

        <h4>Beyond Calligraphy and Illumination</h4>
        <p class="text-lg">
            The art of starch pressing extends far beyond its traditional role in calligraphy and illumination. Even without accompanying artwork, it can be used to create richly textured, layered decorative mats. These mats may stand on their own as refined artistic objects or serve as sophisticated backgrounds for photography, fine art prints, and other creative projects.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            In this way, starch pressing becomes more than a method of preservation, it transforms into a versatile creative medium, opening new possibilities for framing, presenting, and reimagining artworks with depth and elegance.

    <p>Here you can see examples of completed passe-partouts. In fact, the passe-partouts of all my artworks are also examples of starch pressing.</p>
