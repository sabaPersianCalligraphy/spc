            Definition and Etymology of Tazhib (Persian Illumination)
        </h4>
        <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
            Illumination, in Persian called Tazhib, literally means “gilding” or “covering with gold,” and comes from the Arabic word dhahab (gold). In Persian, it is also known as Zarnagareh (golden ornament). This art involves designing, coloring, and gilding with geometric and floral motifs to decorate calligraphic works or the margins of manuscripts, enhancing their beauty. Illumination is considered one of the main branches of Persian miniature art.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:clear-left">
            The origins of illumination and ornamental book design in Iran date back to the Sassanian era. After the advent of Islam, this art came under the patronage of Islamic rulers and became known as “Islamic art.”

        <h4 class="italic font-bold">Schools and Styles of Persian Illumination Through the Ages</h4>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Like painting, illumination has distinct schools and historical periods, including the Seljuk, Bukhara, Timurid, Safavid, and Qajar styles, each with their own branches and characteristics. The illuminations of each period reflect the spirit and aesthetics of their time: 10th-century works are simple and unadorned; those of the 11th and 12th centuries are dignified and harmonious; 14th-century examples are magnificent and powerful; and illuminations from the 15th and 16th centuries are delicate and luxurious.
