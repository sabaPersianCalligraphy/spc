Hi, I’m SaBa, an artist based in Rome, Italy, with a master’s degree in architecture from Roma Tre University. Here, I present my abstract artworks, primarily inspired by the expressive beauty of Siyah-Mashq Persian calligraphy.

            <h4 class="block lg:hidden">Opening Words:</h4>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">My works are abstract expressions that emerge at the intersection of language and form, shaped through Siyah-Mashq in Persian Nastaʿlīq script.</p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Engage with these artworks visually, not linguistically. They are not traditional writings to be read, but visual composition shaped to evoke thought, emotion, and presence.</p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Most people are taught to read words, not truly see them. We invite viewers to shift their experience from language to presence, from text to texture, and from reading to seeing.</p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Visual language enters the realm where words can no longer reach.</p>

            <h4 class="block lg:hidden">Following Words:</h4>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">In these works, every letter and word is chosen with deliberate care and intention.</p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Each verse is a chosen gem from the vast treasury of Persian poetry, carrying a message that is profound, lyrical, and uniquely resonant.</p>

        <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Like a choreographer shaping rhythm and harmony through the movement of bodies, I create harmony, order, and motion using the letters and words of Nastaʿlīq.</p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">My audience spans a broad spectrum, from those who speak Persian to those who may not know the language, but understand the universal language of visual form.</p>

        <h4 class="block lg:hidden">The Art of Persian Literature</h4>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Persian literature stands among the richest and oldest literary traditions in the world. Countless reasons call for it to be shared, celebrated, and reimagined through art. It embodies the identity, resilience, and enduring beauty of a civilization shaped by centuries of change, conquest, and renewal. As a living cultural memory, it connects generations through poetry and wisdom, reminding us of what it means to be human, in both sorrow and joy.

        <h4 class="block lg:hidden">The Silent Script: Where Poetry Becomes Form</h4>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Turning poetry into visual art adds a new dimension giving it presence and a stillness where meaning quietly unfolds over time. I use letters and words, the foundational elements of language and poetry, as a bridge between inner essence and lived memory, a thread that weaves past into future. Through the fluidity of calligraphy and the depth of poetic wisdom, my work seeks to connect people to enduring values that transcend generations. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Language is more than a means of communication; it carries the soul of a culture, the rhythm of its history, and the echoes of its wisdom.<br> In my art, I liberate Persian letters from traditional constraints allowing them to flow freely infused with emotion and meaning beyond the limits of text. Each piece is an invitation to reflect, to remember, and to engage with the timeless truths that shape our shared humanity. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            By weaving language into visual expression, I hope to create an experience that resonates across time reminding us that the past is always present and the future is shaped by what we choose to carry forward.

        <h4 class="block lg:hidden">Traces of Shared Light</h4>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            In this space, it is not only my own energy that flows; it carries the traces of visionary minds whose work opened the way for my art and words to flow into this digital space. It also holds the luminous spirit of poets and philosophers like Rumi, souls who, with their timeless verses, shattered the boundaries of time and space centuries ago, leaving their essence forever in the hearts of lovers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Most of my works are drawn from the purest treasures of Persian poetry, infused with the energy of love, verses that have always inspired me and set me in motion. These creations are born of love, and it is with that same love that they are shared with you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Woven into this space are also the traces of my sisters’ kindness and support, Narvan and Razoline, faithful companions who stood beside me in shaping and refining this home for my art. From this bond flows a current of joy and passion that I cherish with all my heart.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
           If you are an artist or a lover of art, if you own a gallery or can help bring my works to life through exhibitions or by sharing them in your own spaces, I invite you to leave the traces of your pure light here, so that together, through your presence, we may honor and carry forward the journey toward beauty.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
           And I will record these traces of your energy here with respect and love.
