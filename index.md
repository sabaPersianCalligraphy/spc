        My name is SaBa, an artist living in Rome, Italy. I earned my master's degree in architecture from Roma Tre University in 2017. Here, I share my abstract creations, primarily Siyah Mashq Persian calligraphy, where language and visual expression meet. My work grows from a deep awareness of their power to shape our inner landscapes and the worlds we create. I see the value of two forces together guiding us beyond the surface into a quiet space where art becomes a mirror and the connection to oneself unfolds in ways words alone cannot contain.

                <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">My works are abstract expressions that emerge at the intersection of language and form, shaped through Siyah-Mashq in Persian Nastaʿlīq script.</p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Engage with these artworks visually, not linguistically. They are not traditional writings to be read, but visual composition shaped to evoke thought, emotion, and presence.</p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Most people are taught to read words, not truly see them. We invite viewers to shift their experience from language to presence, from text to texture, and from reading to seeing.</p>

                <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Each verse is a chosen gem from the vast treasury of Persian poetry, carrying a message that is profound, lyrical, and uniquely resonant.</p>

            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                Persian literature is one of the richest and oldest literary traditions in the world. There are countless reasons it deserves to be shared, celebrated, and reimagined through art. It carries the identity, resilience, and enduring beauty of a civilization shaped by centuries of change, conquest, and renewal. As a living cultural memory, it connects generations through poetry and wisdom, reminding us of what it means to be human in both our sorrow and joy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                Persian calligraphy and poetry are not just cultural expressions; they are tools for awakening and integrating the foundational aspects of human perception and consciousness. They nourish and elevate each of the five foundations to help one grow into a higher version of oneself.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                Persian poetry is not static; it is a companion. As you evolve:
            </p>
            <ul class="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside md:col-span-4">
                <li>In youth, it enchants your senses,</li>
                <li>In life’s struggles, it comforts your heart,</li>
                <li>In moral challenges, it guides your character,</li>
                <li>In spiritual quests, it bestows wings,</li>
                <li>In legacy, it becomes a living echo of who you have become.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                It sets your values as high as you can imagine, and, more profoundly, helps you become the vessel in which those values reside.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                When your senses are refined, emotions purified, intuition awakened, logic expanded, and imagination liberated, you become a poet of your own life, one who moves with grace, creates with purpose, and sees unity in all things.
            </p>

            <h3 class="hidden lg:block">The Silent Script: Where Poetry Becomes Form</h3>
            <h4 class="block lg:hidden">The Silent Script: Where Poetry Becomes Form</h4>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                Turning poetry into visual art adds a new dimension giving it presence and a stillness where meaning quietly unfolds over time. I use letters and words, the foundational elements of language and poetry, as a bridge between inner essence and lived memory, a thread that weaves past into future. Through the fluidity of calligraphy and the depth of poetic wisdom, my work seeks to connect people to enduring values that transcend generations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                Language is more than a means of communication; it carries the soul of a culture, the rhythm of its history, and the echoes of its wisdom. In my art, I liberate Persian letters from traditional constraints allowing them to flow freely infused with emotion and meaning beyond the limits of text. Each piece is an invitation to reflect, to remember, and to engage with the timeless truths that shape our shared humanity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                By weaving language into visual expression, I hope to create an experience that resonates across time reminding us that the past is always present and the future is shaped by what we choose to carry forward.

            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                In this space, my own energy flows alongside the echoes of visionary minds whose brilliance cleared the path for my art and words to take form here. It holds the luminous souls of poets and philosophers like Rumi, kindred spirits who, through their timeless verses, dissolved the boundaries of time and space, leaving their essence to live on in the hearts of all who love and seek.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                From the timeless garden of Persian poetry, I gather verses that have moved me, awakened me, and carried me forward. Each work is born in love, shaped by love, and offered to you in that same spirit, an invitation to share in its beauty and light.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                Woven into this space are the gentle threads of my sisters’ kindness, Narvan and Razoline, steadfast companions whose love has shaped and refined this home for my art. From our shared bond flows a river of joy and passion, a living current I carry with gratitude and cherish with all my heart.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                If you are an artist or an art lover, guardian of galleries, or a soul who can help these works find their light, whether through exhibitions or by giving them sanctuary in your own space, I invite you to leave the imprint of your pure light here. Together, we can weave a living thread of beauty, carrying it forward so it may shine for generations to come.
